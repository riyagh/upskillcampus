Forecasting Smart City Traffic Patterns aims to transform cities into smart urban cities using digital technologies. One of the problems faced by the government is traffic. To solve this issue and optimize the traffic flow I built a robust traffic system for the city. This model will provide insights for accurate traffic forecasts and helps in understanding the traffic patterns of the four junctions of the city. This project showcases my commitment to urban transformation and data-driven insights.
